I had a little personal pan pizza and the hubby got a meatball sub.  Both were good.  The staff was so nice.  We were the only 2 in there because there was a festival at the park, but food came out fast.\n",

Ordered and tried it, me &the kids......Straight GARBAGE, little to no sauce, excessive amounts of cheese, I don't mind thin crust,  but this crust was super hard and nasty. So far my travels in the great state of Missouri has been disappointing in the cuisine area. BBQ, &Pizza...YUCK!!!\n",
